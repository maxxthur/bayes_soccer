# TODO

- implement a function for tournaments of national teams --> no home effect apart from the host country
- implement a function for leagues
- think about a function for international club tournaments like CL, EL, Conf.L

# Components
- function to shape data correctly in an easy way
- functions to calculate the models easy and as fast as possible -> implement bayesian AND frequentist
- functions to make predictions

# DONT
- automatic data updates, this should be done outside to make the package independent of data issues
